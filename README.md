a record is a **collection of named values**; where a named value is described as a field; and the name of the field incorporates the type of the value. 

therefore
* a database is a record containing many values.
* a collection (eg. an album of photos) is a record
* records have fields
* records can have schemas
* a database is a type of record, therefore it can have a schema
* a field can be a record, if it has the type 'record'
* fields have allowable values (which are set by the schema for the record? - not sure)
